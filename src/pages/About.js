            <p>
                Just two girls out here trying to relax, recharge, and live our best lives. 
                We're planning something bigâ€”a one-year sabbatical in 2028 to explore, learn, and just breathe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life's too short to not take a break and see the world. Stay tuned for our adventures!
